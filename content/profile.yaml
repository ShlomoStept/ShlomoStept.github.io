  about: |
    I'm Shlomo, a machine learning engineer with a passion for researching and implementing the latest ML papers and models to advance my knowledge. I work with companies to create custom AI solutions and am an active member of the Duck AI research group, in addition to my day job.

    In Spring 2023, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Stevens Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, focusing on Machine Learning.

    My technical skills include programming languages such as Python, C++, C, Go, Java, and Scheme. 
    I'm also proficient with libraries like PyTorch, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, OpenCV, Pillow, and HuggingFace-Transformer, 
    as well as technologies like Git/Github, Docker, Django, Nextjs, Vercel, and Azure Machine Learning Studio.

    I enjoy using Linux over MacOS, and (gd-help me) Windows.

    Don't hesitate to contact me for more information. 
    
    Be sure to check out my new website and blog where (coming soom) I'll discuss my ML experiments, papers, and models.
